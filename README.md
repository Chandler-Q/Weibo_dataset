# Weibo_dataset
This is a Python script for processing raw weibo data to build a PyG dataset. This repo includes the Pytorch-Geometric implementation of our Weibo dataset.

We referenced the work of [GNN-FakeNews](https://github.com/safe-graph/GNN-FakeNews) and [FakeNewsNet](https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet) in creating this dataset.
## Instruction
We constructed a Weibo dataset, the original data of the dataset comes from the Chinese Weibo social platform, including a total of 4,664 news, each news constitutes a network, which is represented as a graph, the root node of each tree is "news", and all the other leaf nodes represent "users", as shown in the following figure:

We used pre-trained embeddings [spaCy](https://spacy.io/models/zh#zh_core_web_lg) word2vec and [BERT](https://github.com/jina-ai/clip-as-service) for embedding process.
